# Warehouse Inventory System Model Using a Mobile Robot – Engineering Thesis Topic

Design and implementation of a proven warehouse inventory system model, consisting of a small mobile robot equipped with a camera and a mobile application providing a user interface. The system allows inventory verification through the robot's vision system using QR code recognition. The mobile interface enables users to control the robot's operations and monitor stock levels. Additionally, the robot has a custom 3D-printed body specifically designed for it. The main components of the robot include an ESP32-CAM, Arduino Uno R3, and a Motor Shield.
