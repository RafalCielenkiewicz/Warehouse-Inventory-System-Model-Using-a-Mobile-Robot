# Model of a warehouse inventory system using amobile robot


## About

This project presents a comprehensive warehouse inventory system utilizing a mobile robot equipped with a camera and a mobile application. The system enables automated inventory verification through QR code recognition using computer vision. The mobile application provides an intuitive user interface for remote robot control and real-time stock level monitoring. The robot features a custom 3D-printed body designed specifically for this project. Key components of the robot include the ESP32-CAM, Arduino Uno R3, and a Motor Shield. The data is displayed in real-time on an administrator panel, and users can add or remove QR codes via Postman.


## Features

* Automated QR code scanning and inventory status updates.
* Remote robot control via a web interface.
* Live video streaming from the robot's camera.
* Real-time inventory status display.
* Ability to add and remove inventory items.
* Custom 3D-printed robot chassis.
* Real-time communication.

## Components

* **ESP32-CAM:** Handles video streaming, QR code recognition, and WiFi communication.
* **Arduino Uno R3:** Controls robot movement via the Motor Shield.
* **Motor Shield (L293D):** Enables control of DC motors.
* **4 x DC Motors with Wheels:** Provide robot movement.
* **18650 Li-Ion Batteries:** Provide power to the robot.
* **Custom 3D-Printed Chassis:** Ensures stability and protection of components.
